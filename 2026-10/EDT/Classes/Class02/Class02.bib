	abstract = {Remote Sensing and Image Interpretation, 7th Edition is designed to be primarily used in two ways: as a textbook in the introductory courses in remote sensing and image interpretation, and as a reference for the burgeoning number of practitioners who use geospatial information and analysis in their work. Because of the wide range of academic and professional settings in which this book might be used, we have made the discussion “discipline neutral.” In short, anyone involved in geospatial data acquisition and analysis should find this book to be a valuable text and reference.},

	abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) software packages can be prohibitively expensive, causing many to shy away from mapping and spatial analysis. This 7-page fact sheet written by Jeffry M. Flenniken, Steven Stuglik, and Basil V. Iannone III and published by the UF/IFAS School of Forest Resources and Conservation introduces the reader to a free GIS software package called Quantum GIS (QGIS), walking the reader through simple GIS processes that can be used to visualize spatial patterns of importance to a variety of fields, including natural resources, agriculture, and urban planning. Learn how to create a land-cover map for a county of interest and create heatmaps that illustrate the density of a given attribute (Florida Springs for this example). This publication will benefit those interested in incorporating GIS into their work but who are unable to afford expensive proprietary GIS software packages, as well as anyone interested in learning a new GIS software package. https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fr428},

	abstract = {The QGIS project is a prominent open-source geographic information system (GIS) that has evolved over two decades, contributing significantly to the geospatial community. This paper presents the development, governance, and operational challenges faced by QGIS, providing an in-depth analysis of its growth from a hobby project to a global platform. We examine the project’s organizational structure, release management, and infrastructure, alongside the financial model that sustains its development. The paper also addresses key challenges such as licensing complexities, group decision-making dynamics, and the balancing of innovation with stability in an open-source environment. Additionally, we highlight QGIS’s broad applicability across industries and its continued success in fostering community-driven development.},
